    <h2>Why Indian Millennials Prefer Affordable Gold Jewelry</h2>
    <p>Indian millennials are balancing their cultural heritage with modern trends and financial pragmatism. Gold remains a symbol of prosperity and status, but affordability has become a key factor due to changing lifestyles and economic realities.</p>

    <h2>Top Affordable Gold Jewelry Trends in 2025</h2>
    <p>Here are the hottest trends that Indian millennials are embracing this year, helping them stay elegant while keeping their investments wise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Minimalist Gold Chains:</strong> Simple yet elegant gold chains in delicate designs are favored for daily wear. They pair perfectly with both casual and formal attire.</li>
